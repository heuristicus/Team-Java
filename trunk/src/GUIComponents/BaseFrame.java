/**
 * Seems like somewhere in here we need to have the keylisteners and
 * mouselisteners, since the frame is what is focused when you're clicking and
 * pressing keys. This means that the mousecontrol and keyboardcontrol classes
 * should be instances of keylistener and mouselistener so that we can just
 * pass those to the addlistener methods. Of couse, this is only guesswork, since
 * i've not done it before. Many problems here. I suggest for the time being we do
 * it the simple way and just make listeners in here to listen for things.
 * But there's another problem! If we're using this frame as the main thing, and
 * we're swapping panels, then listeners have to do different things based on game
 * state - might be solvable if we reference the panel and get the game state.
