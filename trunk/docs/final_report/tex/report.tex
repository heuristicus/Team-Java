\begin{abstract}
In this project, we have created a top-down scrolling space shooter game with networked functionality. As far as we are aware, in this genre there are few examples of games which have capability for networked play, and therefore it could be considered that a networked game is rather novel in this particular area. We have attampted to make the game as modular as possible to allow for quick addition of new types of enemies, and have also used a method which means that both enemy ships and all projectiles can be made to follow paths which can use mathematical equations to specify the next position for a given moving object.
