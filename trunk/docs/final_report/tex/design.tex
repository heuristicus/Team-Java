\label{cha:design}

This section is crucial. Describe the overall structure of your
program at a suitably high level of abstraction. For instance, UML
diagrams or informal box-and-arrow diagrams can be used to describe
program structure. Be sure to describe the MVC structure used. Note
that code listings or screenshots are not appropriate here. An
important point is how you have divided the project into modules
that different team members can work on, and how these are then
integrated. For example, you could use interfaces to describe a
clean boundary between modules, so that some team members use the
functionality provided by the interface, while another team member
implements it. Bear in mind Software Engineering principles of good
design like coherence and coupling.

\section{Release Plan}
\label{sec: release_plan}
This section outlines the proposed release plan of the project. It has been decided that the project will take the incremental approach of software development with acceptance testing taking place at each stage. The six internal releases will be implemented consecutively to bring the project to the first public release within the 10 week timeframe.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Version 0.1:} Basic player spaceship (Java shape) on screen with controls and movement.
\item \textbf{Version 0.2:} Basic shooting from the player's spaceship.
\item \textbf{Version 0.3:} Static enemies on the screen, player able to shoot the enemy and score incremented.
\item \textbf{Version 0.4:} Enemies have movement with the use of paths, are able to shoot back and collide with players.
\item \textbf{Version 0.5:} Background scrolling, enemies are spawned at regular intervals at set points using a timer.
\item \textbf{Version 0.6:} Multiplayer networking implemented.
\end{itemize} This brings the project to the first public stable release which satisfies the requirements for the assessment. It time is available certain future requirements (section \ref{sec: future_requirements}) towards the second public release.

\section{Class Design}
